# Octavate
Octavate is about pricing risk in the music industry, both with respect to
intellectual property and artist development. While music as a category is
undervalued except at the highest level—when people overpay—Octavate sees the
industry as a sort of “safe haven” investment that, with the proper approach,
can act as an insurance policy against systemic risk given its tiny relative
size. Octavate believes that algorithmic curation has had a detrimental effect
on global culture and knows there are problems connecting talent to the proper
sources. By focusing on sonic purity and using technology to maintain a keen
awareness of global events, Octavate will avoid overpaying for intellectual
property while expanding the size of the industry’s middle class for decades
to come. A systematic technological appraoach leveraging information sciences,
powerful visualization algorithms and techniques, and machine learning is used
in order to help Octavate in reaching its goal.
